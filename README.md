# zshrc

My ZSH configuration is quite minimal. I like adding aliases and key bindings to make life easier.

To use, copy over the contents of the .zshrc file to yours (you'll find it at `~/.zshrc`). Then create a `zsh` folder in your `~/.config` folder and copy the contents in this repos `zsh` there.
